# myretail-tacs
A PoC RESTful service that combines product information with pricing

##### Building from Source

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) wrapper is used for the build system

myRetail was developed with [STS](https://spring.io/tools/sts) with the [Eclipse Buildship plugin](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjKz4G12MnmAhWSFTQIHfoABc8QFjAAegQIChAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fprojects.eclipse.org%2Fprojects%2Ftools.buildship&usg=AOvVaw3w79u_pTg-smfQ0zfK5PIN) and can be imported as a gradle project. The project will automatically build as part of the import

To run the project outside of STS, run the `./gradlew bootRun` from the project directory
